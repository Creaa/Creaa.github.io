### MyPokeDex
MyPokeDex is my first own project. Whole idea based on device's which appeared in television show - Pokemon. This is a main difference between other Pokedex maded using website list. 

## Technology

To make this project I used:

- React.js
- SASS
- JSON (in progress)
- JavaScript
- EcmaScript 6
- Webpack


## Disclaimer:
Most Pokemon's photo graphic's are static. But I would like to change. 

Voices of Pokemon's are from original source (Pokemon Red), but some of them I replaced from TV show. Its time-consuming job and I will change it step by step.

Some of Pokemon's have a special animation, triggered when you click on his picture. 
Now it is only couple of them, but my goal is make over 20 special animations of most characteristic Poke's.
